'''
Currently, this web server handles only one HTTP request at a time which in
practice is not efficient for handling multiple connections but it gives us a
starting point for looking at the HTTP protocol.

        Things to check:
            1. type of request - Is it supported or unsupported
            2. the resource that is being looked for
            3. the path (assuming that the root is in the same directory as the
            server)
            4. check the encoding type
            5. generate a response header with the correct information - You
            will need to think about the structure of what this need to be based
            on the requirements for the lab.
            6. send the response

        TIP:
            -check out what spilt() does to a Python string as you might find
            it useful.

        Remember:
            -The socket connections have been taken care of for you; all you
            need to concentrate on is the L5 protocol for HTTP.
