# Basic HTTP Server

A manually built HTTP protocol implementation that handles GET requests. Created as a networks class assignment.

## Description

This project implements a basic HTTP server from scratch, demonstrating fundamental networking concepts and the HTTP protocol. The server is designed to handle GET requests, providing hands-on experience with low-level network programming.

## Features

- Manual implementation of HTTP protocol
- Handles GET requests
- Educational project for learning network fundamentals

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

List any dependencies or requirements needed to run the server.

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/KeirPar/Basic_HTTP_Server.git
cd Basic_HTTP_Server
```

### Usage

```bash

python3 webserver.py -p 9999

```

Then go visit localhost:9999 and try accessing the different types of files in the directory

## Learning Objectives

This project was built to understand:
- HTTP protocol fundamentals
- Network socket programming
- Client-server communication
- Request/response handling

## Limitations

- Currently only supports GET requests
- Basic implementation for educational purposes

## License
